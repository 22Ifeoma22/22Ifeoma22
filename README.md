# 🦁 Sue Eze — Responsible AI Governance & Assurance

MSc Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) University of Wolverhampton (ongoing)  
Specialising in **AI Governance, Accountability, Risk & Compliance**.

I build **AI governance frameworks** that ensure:
- Compliance with **GDPR Article 22**, **EU AI Act**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, **ISO 27001/27701**
- Fair, explainable and accountable AI system behaviour
- Clear human oversight and escalation paths
- Protection against algorithmic harm

---

###  Signature Framework
**The Big Map ROAR Framework**  
A systemic harm assessment model used to analyse case studies of AI failures across:

1. **Data Governance** — If data is unrepresentative → the system learns harm  
2. **Model Governance** — If logic is not explainable → harm becomes unchallengeable  
3. **Deployment Governance** — If oversight is missing → harm becomes automatic  
4. **Monitoring & Incident Response** — If behaviour is not observed → harm persists silently  
5. **Accountability & Redress (RACI)** — If no one owns the outcome → people have **no route to correction**

**Legal Anchor:** *Under GDPR Article 22, individuals cannot be subjected to solely automated decisions without meaningful human oversight and a clear path to contest the outcome.*
