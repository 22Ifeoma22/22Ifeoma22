MSc Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) University of Wolverhampton (ongoing)  
Specialising in **AI Governance, Accountability, Risk & Compliance**.

I build **AI governance frameworks** that ensure:
- Compliance with **GDPR Article 22**, **EU AI Act**, **ISO/IEC 42001**, **ISO 27001/27701**

###  Signature Framework
## Practical AI Governance in Action
This profile includes hands-on examples demonstrating how I operationalise:
- Explainability (SHAP, LIME)

- ISO 42001 lifecycle governance controls
- Continuous monitoring and drift detection

→ Turning responsible AI principles into **auditable evidence**.
